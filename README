Yabag - Yet Another Ball Game 

##############
# 1. Install #
##############

Yabag requires the Pygame-library for Python, you can obtain it from
http://pygame.org/download.shtml or via your distro's repositories;
Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) for example keeps it as 'python-pygame'.

Furthermore, you need to have a new-ish version of Python on your system.

Then, checkout the repository into the desired folder, for example:

  cd ~/Games
  git clone git://github.com/baumanno/Yabag.git

This will create a folder 'Yabag' in ~/Games.

##########
# 2. Run #
##########

To run Yabag:

  cd ~/Games/Yabag
  python run.py

That's all!

###############
# 3. Gameplay #
###############

Its plain simple: balls speed across the screen. If your mousepointer
hits a ball, you loose. The longer you last, the better (as usual...)

#################
# 4. Difficulty #
#################

If you are some sort of fleet-fingered mouse-meister, Yabag might be
a bit too easy for you. Try changing some variables:

  run.py:7 Change 'numBalls' to set the total number of balls
           (a higher number results in increased difficulty)
  run.py:8 Change 'delay' to set the overall speed of the game loop
           (a lower value results in increased difficulty)

# 5. Feedback #

Feel free to send any sort of feedback.
You'll surely find the email somewhere on github ;-)


-- Have fun!!
